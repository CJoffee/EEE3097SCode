[Shane]
You're like a storm againt the windon,
follow me around just like a shadow;
I'll swim a never-ending ocean,
until you bring back your devotion.

[Mark]
It's like I live a thousand lifetimes,
still looking for the one that feels right;
see, moving on just isn't working,
you lit the fire that I'm buring.

[Chorus]
And all I've been doing is protecting
a lie for the sake of my pride.
While all the others set me thinking:
we could be more than just amazing.

[Shane]
I guess I'm holding on to my faith,
a solid hope I'm heading your way;
and crawling over is so tempting,
we could be more than just amazing...

[Chorus]
And all I've been doing is protecting
a lie for the sake of my pride.
While all the otehrs set me thinking:
we could be more than just amazing.

[Kian]
I couldn't see it,
[Mark]
I must have believed the lie.
[Shane]
If I admit it would you like me make it right?
[Nicky]
Is it all gone?
Oh no...

[Shane]
We could be more than just...

[Chorus]
We could be more than just amazing (ey yeah),

And all I've been doing is protecting
a lie for the sake of my pride.
While all the others set me thinking:
we could be more than just amazing (ey yeah).

And all I've been doing is protecing
a lie for the sake of my pride.
While all the others set me thinking,
straight to the point of what I'm feeling,
oh, we could be more than just amazing.
